# Friday-Night-Funkin-Bot
It's a bot that automatically plays FnF. It has support for a range of resolutions, including 1440p, 1080p, and 720p.
# Use
To use the application, make sure you have a normal install of FNF, with any mods that do not alter the location of the arrows.
Make sure you have a monitor that can display the supported resolutions, or have a monitor larger than any of them that is set to 1440p, 1080p, or 720p in windows settings. 1080p is no longer in beta, and 720p is experimental.
# Installation
All you have to do to install is go to the most recent release of the application and download the .exe file that is there, and make sure you have the c++ visual redistributable 2015 downloaded
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
and just open the application from there. Make sure the game is windowed and full screened.
# Issues
It sometimes misses notes, which is just because it does it real time, and isn't precalculated.
It also sometimes is marked as a virus by windows defender, because it checks the display buffer and it really doesn't like that; I have submitted it to microsoft to get it fixed.
