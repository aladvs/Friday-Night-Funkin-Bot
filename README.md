# Friday-Night-Funkin-Bot
It's a bot that automatically plays fnf without any extra libraries! Works on 1440p and 1080 monitors only.
# Use
To use the application, make sure you have a normal install of FNF, with any mods that do not alter the location of the arrows.
Make sure you have a 1440p or 1080p monitor, or have a monitor larger that is set to 1440p or 1080p in windows settings. 1080p is no longer in beta.
# Installation
All you have to do is go to the most recent release of the application and download the .exe file that is there, and make sure you have the c++ visual redistributable 2015 downloaded
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
and just open the application from there. Make sure the game is in full view, but not full screen, so you can see the top application bar and taskbar, but it's otherwise full screen.
# Issues
It sometimes misses notes, which is just because it does it real time, and isn't precalculated.
It also is marked as a virus by windows defender, because it checks the display buffer and it really doesn't like that; I have submitted it to microsoft to get it fixed.
